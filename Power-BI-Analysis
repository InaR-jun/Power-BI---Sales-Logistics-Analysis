# 📊 Power BI Dashboard: E-Commerce Sales and Logistics Deep Dive

## Project Goal
This project was executed as a contracted Data Analyst assignment to design and implement a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) across a large e-commerce platform's **Sales and Logistics** operations over 15 months. The primary objective was to provide executive-level insights and detailed interactive views for strategic decision-making.

## 🛠️ Key Skills & Technologies Demonstrated

This project showcases a broad range of Power BI and data analysis expertise:

* **Data Modeling & Transformation:** Establishing complex table relationships, managing data cardinality, and utilizing **Power Query (ETL)** to denormalize the **Orders** table for funnels and creating computed columns for product categorization.
* **DAX Proficiency:** Implementing complex measures, including **scalar and iterative DAX expressions**, for custom metric calculation (e.g., Year-over-Year comparison, Content Switching logic).
* **UX/UI and Design:** Prototyping and designing an intuitive interface across four distinct tabs (Sales, Logistics, Payments, Reviews), employing a consistent theme, color palette, and logical block structuring.
* **Advanced Functionality:** Implementing dynamic features such as buttons, bookmarks, pop-up information blocks, drill-through pages, and content switching using DAX.

## 📈 Core Metrics and Analysis Tabs

The dashboard is structured around four main analysis tabs, visualizing a wide array of KPIs:

| Analysis Tab | Sales Metrics | Logistics Metrics | Other Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sales** | Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), Conversion Rate (Sales/Leads), Active Customer Base, Sales Rankings. | N/A | Events Funnel (Order Created -> Delivered), Geographic Sales Map. |
| **Logistics** | N/A | **On-time Delivery Rate**, Cost per Unit Shipment, Average Order Processing Time, Average Order Cycle Time. | Shipping Time Dynamics. |
| **Payments** | Self-Service Analytical Block: **Payment Type Breakdown**, Installment Analysis. | N/A | N/A |
| **Reviews** | Self-Service Analytical Block: **Review Scores**, Sentiment Dynamics, Customer Feedback Analysis. | N/A | N/A |

## 📦 Project Structure and Data
The analysis utilizes a public Brazilian e-commerce dataset, structured into seven core tables:

* **Customers**
* **Geolocation**
* **Orders**
* **Order Payments**
* **Order Items**
* **Products**
* **Sellers**
* **Order Reviews**
